# Handle traffic via message queue

## Concept
I need some machnism for hold and limitation traffic in my application, Becuse I found some issue mad me up via tsumani efface, And This POC I work with the OpenAI to tech me.

## AI Concept
Set up a Kafka cluster: You can use services like Confluent Cloud or set up a Kafka cluster locally using Kafka binaries or Docker.

1. Install the kafka-node package: This is a Node.js client for Kafka that provides a high-level Producer and Consumer API. You can install it using NPM by running npm install kafka-node.

1. Create a Kafka producer: A producer sends messages to a Kafka topic. You can create a new producer using the kafka-node package and then use it to send messages to a Kafka topic whenever a new request comes in from the client.

1. Create a Kafka consumer: A consumer reads messages from a Kafka topic. You can create a new consumer using the kafka-node package and then use it to consume messages from the Kafka topic whenever the backend API is ready to process a new message.

1. Implement a backend API: This is the API that will process the requests from the client. Whenever a new message is received from Kafka, the backend API should process it and send a response back to the client.

1. Handle concurrency: To handle concurrent requests, you can use a library like async or bluebird to run multiple requests in parallel.

1. Scale horizontally: To handle high traffic, you can scale the Kafka cluster and the backend API horizontally by adding more instances.

1. Handle errors: Make sure to handle errors properly in your system to prevent data loss or corruption.

1. These are just general steps to follow, and there may be more specific steps depending on your use case. But I hope this helps you get started with building your message queue system! Let me know if you have any further questions.

# Build and run

```bash
    docker build -t myapi .

    docker-compose up
```

# Test

produce the message via frontend api
```bash
curl -X POST -d ' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "tes"}' http://localhost/messages
```

check massage consume as kafka shell
```bash
kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
--topic my-topic \
--from-beginning

```
